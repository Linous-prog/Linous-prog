Hi, my name is Matheus, I'm 23 years old. When I was a kid, I had my first contact with technology, and it was love at first sight. But I always considered technology as entertainment, rather than seeing it as a job. When I was 22 years old, I started learning about web development. After seeing it, the passion inside me overflowed again, but this time to become a developer. After this, I became a curious person, trying to learn as much as I can. Now I'm learning Python because it's a simple programming language used to build websites, software, etc. For me, it's a great opportunity because I know it's very challenging, but it's also very rewarding. After I got to this point, I started learning French and improving my English. I have more goals for the future, but for now, I'll keep learning Python and improving my language skills. At the moment, my English is intermediate, but it's going to get better soon. My French is at a beginner level, and I speak Portuguese as my native language. (I think our brain is like a muscle; the more you train it, the better you get.)
